##Chapter 1 : Building Abstractions with Procedures

*  The Elements of Programming
    * [Ex 01][1] Evaluating a sequence of expressions
    * [Ex 02][2] Translating from infix to prefix
    * [Ex 03][3] Sum of squares of the two largest inputs
    * [Ex 04][4] Evaluating operator
    * [Ex 05][5] How does the expression evaluate
    * [Ex 06][6] What happens when we define a new conditional
    * [Ex 07][7] A better good-enough function
    * [Ex 08][8] Cube root using Newton's method

*  Procedures and the Processes They Generate
    * [Ex 09][9] Iterative vs recursive evaluation
    * [Ex 10][10] Cube root using Newton's method
    * [Ex 28][28] Miller-Rabin primality test

*  Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures
